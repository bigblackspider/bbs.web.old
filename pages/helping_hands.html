                    <p>Whenever there is a technical problem or you need that extra support we are there to help at a
                        moment
                        notice. As call out fees are can be expensive we aim to reduce your business running costs to an
                        absolute minimum by ensuring that we provide off site support by remote access. Where we are
                        unable
                        to fix the problem remotely we will provide on site technical support and repairs.
                        We offer different packages of ongoing support to suit your individual budget and requirements.
                        This
                        can be either a Call out basis where you pay an hourly rate for a service provided, or a fixed
                        price
                        package provided and renewed on a monthly basis.
