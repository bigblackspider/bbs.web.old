                <p>How long can your business operate without your computers?</p>

                <p>Managed Services can give your business an IT professional for a fixed monthly fee that creates
                    predictable costs. An outsourced IT professional can be responsible for specifics tasks such as help
                    desk support and network management or can handle the complex management of your business’ entire IT
                    infrastructure. From small IT projects to large responsibilities, contracting with an IT
                    professional makes sense in terms of managing costs while having access to the latest technology and
                    skills. Are you making the most informed decisions about your business’ technology solutions?</p>

                <h2>Service Plans</h2>

                <p> A customer once remarked “I have to pay you every time my network goes down, how do I know you’re
                    really trying to solve my problems?”</p>

                <p>It’s a good question, because most business service plans that IT service companies offer make money
                    when you have problems, so do they really have an incentive to keep problems from happening in the
                    first place? What would happen if we focused on preventing computer problems, instead of waiting for
                    them to happen and then reacting?</p>

                <p>How would less computer downtime impact the productivity and stress levels of your business service
                    plans? How would it feel to walk in the door on Monday morning and know that your computers were
                    going to work?</p>
