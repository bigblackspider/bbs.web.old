                    <p>There are times where you just cant fix things remotely. Maybe the internet connection is broken
                        or a centralised hub has stopped working. No worries, we will send out a technician to get you
                        working.
                    </p>

                    <p>You can build in onsite support as part of <a href="#support_managed" class="page-scroll">managed
                        services
                        package</a>. Alternately you can use
                        <a href="#helping_hands" class="page-scroll">helping hands solution</a> as a temporary measure.
                    </p>

                    <p>If you computers are unserviceable we will look at alternate solution that include using our
                        servers on the Cloud to get you back on track.</p>

                    <p> Whatever the option you choose we will get you up and running in no time.</p>
