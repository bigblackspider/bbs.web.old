                    <p>Majority of problems can be fixed by remote support. We can connect to you and resolve the query
                        or problem remotely saving time and money. Remote Assistance can be provided on a case by case
                        basis or we can deploy our remote agent to your computers for faster resolution. </p>

                        we can set up dual control so we can guide you through step by step.</p>
